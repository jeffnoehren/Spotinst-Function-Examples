|[Get All Elastigroups](./node-spotinst-api-getGroups)  This example shows you how to connect to the Spotinst API and return all the Elastigroups that were created in the past hour|
|[Scale Down Elastigroups](./node-elastigroup-scaleDown)  This function will allow you to connect to your Elastigroup and scale it down. This is super useful if you hook them up to a timer to auto-scale for you|
|[Scale Up Elastigroups](./node-elastigroup-scaleUp)  This function will allow you to connect to your Elastigroup and scale it up. This is super useful if you hook them up to a timer to auto-scale for you|
|[Elastigroup Set Target](./node-elastigroup-setTarget)  This example will allow you to connect to your Elastigroup and set the target, min and max capacity limits|
|[Suspend Scaling Policies](./node-spotinst-api-suspendPolicy)  This example shows you how to connect to the Spotinst API to suspend scaling policies on your elastigroups|
|[Resume Scaling Policies](./node-spotinst-api-resumePolicy)  This example shows you how to connect to the Spotinst API to resume scaling policies on your elastigroups|
